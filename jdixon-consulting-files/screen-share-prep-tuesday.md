# Screen Share Prep: Tuesday, December 9th

## Meeting Context

**Purpose:** Observe Jesse's current workflow live and identify the remaining pain points
**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Key insight going in:** Jesse already has 75% of the solution working. We're looking for the last 25%.

## What's Changed Since First Call

| First Call Understanding | Updated Reality |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| Jesse spends 4 hours per report | Down to 20-30 min with Gemini |
| Needs full AI pipeline | Has working pipeline, needs last-mile |
| Problem: transcription + organization | Problem: formatting + photo correlation |
| Build from scratch | Optimize what works, fix what doesn't |

---

## Agenda (60 min)

### 1. Warm-Up (5 min)
- Quick confirmation of his current state
- "Walk me through what you do now from start to finish"

### 2. Live Workflow Demo (25 min)

**Watch him do:**
- [ ] Show a recent voice recording/transcription
- [ ] Demo the Gemini prompt he uses
- [ ] Show the Gemini output
- [ ] The copy/paste into Affinity
- [ ] Photo placement process
- [ ] Final formatting/polish

**Observe:**
- Where does he pause or hesitate?
- What takes multiple attempts?
- Where does he say "this is the annoying part"?
- How long does each step actually take?

### 3. Review Output (15 min)
- [ ] Look at 2-3 finished field reports
- [ ] What makes a "good" report in his view?
- [ ] What would he change if he could?
- [ ] How do these compare to what clients/builders expect?

### 4. The Problem Statement (10 min)
- "If I could wave a magic wand, what would be different?"
- "What's the ONE thing that would make the biggest difference?"
- "If we solved just the Affinity problem, would you still need help?"

### 5. Next Steps (5 min)
- Discuss options (see below)
- Timeline expectations
- Budget conversation if appropriate

## Questions to Answer

### About the Workflow
1. What exact Gemini prompt are you using?
2. How do you organize photos after a site visit?
3. How do you match photos to specific notes/observations?
4. Is the Affinity template the same every time or different per project?
5. How many photos typically go in a report?

### About the Output
6. Who receives this report? (builder, client, both, internal?)
7. What do they do with it? (action items, documentation, legal?)
8. Any specific formatting requirements from recipients?
9. What feedback have you gotten on report quality?

### About the Team
10. Do the other 3 PMs do reports the same way?
11. Are they using AI at all currently?
12. Would they adopt a new system if you had one?
13. Who would train them?

### About the Business
14. What would Jim say is the priority here?
15. Ballpark: what's reasonable to spend on this? (hourly/project)
16. Is there a busy season coming that makes this urgent?

## Hypotheses to Validate

### Hypothesis 1: The Affinity Bottleneck
"The main remaining pain is the manual copy/paste and photo placement in Affinity. A template-based solution that auto-generates layout would save significant time."

**Validation:** Watch the Affinity portion. Time it. Ask: "If this step took 5 minutes instead of X, would the problem be solved?"

### Hypothesis 2: Photo Correlation
"The hard part is matching the right photos to the right notes. An organized naming/tagging system would help."

**Validation:** Look at his camera roll or photo folder. How organized is it? Does he know which photo goes where?

### Hypothesis 3: Template Consistency
"Jesse wants the same output format every time. A rigid template with variable content would work."

**Validation:** Compare 2-3 reports. Are they structurally identical or different each time?

### Hypothesis 4: Team Scale
"The real value is rolling this out to 4 PMs doing 12 reports/week, not just Jesse."

**Validation:** Ask about other PMs. Are they aware of Jesse's improvements? Interested?

## Potential Solution Paths

Based on what we learn, options might include:

### Option A: Prompt Engineering + Workflow Guide
- Optimize Jesse's Gemini prompts
- Document best practices
- Create training materials for team
- Lightest lift, lowest cost

### Option B: Custom Template System
- Build template that accepts Gemini output + photos
- Auto-generates formatted report
- Could be Google Docs, Notion, custom tool
- Medium complexity

### Option C: End-to-End Pipeline
- Voice → Transcription → AI processing → Formatted output
- Photo integration built-in
- Custom-built solution
- Higher complexity, higher value

### Option D: Tool Replacement
- Replace Affinity with something purpose-built
- Might be existing tool (Canva, Notion, etc.)
- Might be custom
- Depends on what we see Tuesday

## Red Flags to Watch For

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| "Actually it's pretty good now" | Might not need consulting |
| "Let me ask Jim first" | Jesse can't commit on his own |
| Workflow is messy/inconsistent | Harder to systematize |
| Photos are disorganized | Need to solve that first |
| "The other PMs won't use this" | Limited scale |

---

## What Success Looks Like

**By end of screen share, we should know:**
1. Exactly what the Affinity pain point is (specific, not vague)
2. Whether photo correlation is a real problem or minor annoyance
3. If there's appetite for team rollout
4. Rough budget/timeline expectations
5. Clear next step (proposal? hourly engagement? pass?)
