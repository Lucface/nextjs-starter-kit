# Follow-Up Discovery Call - Jesse Gugliotta

**Date:** Early December 2024
**Attendees:** Jesse Gugliotta, Lucas Cooper-Bey
**Duration:** ~60 minutes
**Type:** Deep-dive discovery / workflow validation

---

## Major Update: Jesse Already Using AI Successfully

**Key Revelation:** Jesse has already started using Gemini for field reports on his own and is seeing significant results.

### Current AI Workflow (Self-Implemented)
1. Records voice notes on phone during/after site visit
2. Pastes transcription into Gemini
3. Gemini returns organized, structured notes
4. Copy/paste into Affinity for final formatting

### Results Achieved
- **Before:** ~2 hours per field report
- **After:** ~20-30 minutes per field report
- **Time saved:** 75-85% reduction

### Remaining Pain Point
- The copy/paste into Affinity is still clunky
- Wants template-based system: provide example + new data + photos → formatted output
- Open to replacing Affinity with a better solution

## Key New Information

### Firm-Wide Scale (Bigger Than Expected)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Project managers doing reports | 4 people |
| Reports per PM per week | ~3 |
| Total reports firm-wide | ~12/week |
| Annual reports | ~600+ |

### Decision Making & Budget
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Decision maker | Jim (James Dixon) - owner |
| Decision style | Collaborative with team input |
| Consulting preference | Hourly initially, then project scope |
| Retainer interest | No - prefer project-based |

### What Jesse Actually Values
Not just time savings. The real value:
- **Quality of notes** - professional tone
- **Conciseness** - not verbose
- **Framing** - how things are presented
- **Correlation** - notes matched to photos
- **Layout** - brochure-like, visual appeal

## Key Quotes

> "I've already started using Gemini and it's working pretty well"

> "Cut my time from about 2 hours to 20-30 minutes"

> "The copy-paste into Affinity is still the annoying part"

> "I want to give it an example of what I want, then new data and photos, and get back a formatted report"

> "I'm not attached to Affinity - if there's something better, I'd switch"

> "It's not just about speed - the quality of the writing matters more"

## Updated Understanding

### What Jesse Wants (Refined)
1. **Template system** - Provide example output, get consistent results
2. **Photo correlation** - Notes matched to specific photos
3. **Brochure layout** - Not just text dump, visually professional
4. **End-to-end pipeline** - Voice → finished PDF, minimal manual steps

### What's NOT the Problem Anymore
- Transcription (solved with phone + Gemini)
- Initial note organization (Gemini handles well)
- Basic time savings (already achieved 75%+ reduction)

### What IS Still the Problem
- Final formatting/layout
- Photo placement and correlation
- Consistency across reports
- The "last mile" from organized notes → polished deliverable

## Questionnaire Answers (Verbal)

Several questions from the questionnaire were answered in conversation:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Field report priority | Already started solving - wants to optimize further |
| Reports per week (firm) | ~12 (4 PMs × 3 each) |
| Time per report (current) | 20-30 min with AI, was 2 hours |
| Who decides | Jim (owner), collaborative |
| Budget approach | Hourly to start, then project-based |
| Recording allowed | Yes, already doing it |
| Affinity attachment | Low - open to alternatives |
| Timeline | Interested, screen share Tuesday |

---

## Screen Share Scheduled

**When:** Tuesday the 9th
**Purpose:** Watch Jesse's current workflow live
**Focus areas:**
1. Voice note → Gemini process
2. Affinity formatting workflow
3. Photo organization/correlation
4. See actual output examples

---

## Revised Opportunity Assessment

### Original Hypothesis
"Jesse spends 4 hours per report and needs full automation pipeline"

### Updated Reality
"Jesse already has working AI pipeline saving 75% time. Opportunity is the 'last mile' - formatting, layout, photo correlation, and scaling to 4 PMs."

### New Value Proposition
1. **Polish the pipeline** - Optimize what's already working
2. **Solve the layout problem** - Replace Affinity bottleneck
3. **Create templates** - Consistent, professional output
4. **Scale to team** - Train other 3 PMs on optimized workflow

---

## Action Items

- [x] Scheduled screen share for Tuesday the 9th
- [ ] Prepare screen share agenda focused on remaining pain points
- [ ] Research template-based document generation tools
- [ ] Think about photo → text correlation solutions
- [ ] Consider Affinity alternatives for the team

## Updated Red Flags Assessment

| Red Flag | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Low frequency | CLEARED | 12 reports/week firm-wide |
| No decision authority | CLEARED | Jim decides, Jesse has input |
| Recording not possible | CLEARED | Already doing it |
| Satisfied with current | WATCH | Already 75% better - is remaining 25% worth paying for? |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Tuesday Screen Share** - Observe live workflow
2. **Identify Last Mile Solution** - What replaces Affinity pain?
3. **Scope Options:**
   - Option A: Optimize Jesse's workflow only
   - Option B: Build system for all 4 PMs
   - Option C: Template + training package
4. **Prepare mini-proposal** for after screen share
