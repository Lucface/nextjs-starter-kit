## Jesse Gugliotta (Primary Contact)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Role | Architect - Construction Observation |
| Responsibilities | Weekly site visits, field reports, project management |
| Tenure | Long-term employee |
| Relationship | Lucas's brother |

### What Jesse Does
1. Schematic Design - Conceptual presentations with precedent images
2. Design Development - CAD drafting, ballpark pricing
3. Construction Documents - Detailed drawing sets
4. Construction Observation - Weekly site visits, field reports

### Tools He Uses
- SketchUp for 3D modeling
- AutoCAD for drafting
- Affinity for reports/presentations
- Gemini for image generation (experimenting)
- Google Lens for reverse image search

### Pain Points
1. **Field Reports** - Takes half his day (~4 hours per report)
2. **Precedent Image Search** - Multi-step Gemini/Google Lens workaround

### Ideal Solution
"Record my conversations on a site meeting and then tell AI to type up some notes and include these pictures and then give me a field report"

### AI Boundaries
- No AI-generated images in client presentations
- Enhancement not replacement of creative process
- Human deliverables are the firm's value proposition

## Competitive Position

- Dual-region presence (NY + Portland) - rare
- Historic + modern blend - differentiated niche
- Major press (NYT, WSJ, AD) - credibility
- Premium positioning - can afford quality consulting
