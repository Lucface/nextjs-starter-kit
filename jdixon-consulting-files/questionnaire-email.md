**Subject:** Quick recap + a few questions before we dive in

Hey Jesse,

Great talking yesterday. Before we schedule a screen share, I want to make sure I captured everything correctly and fill in a few gaps.

## WHAT I HEARD (correct me where I'm wrong)

**About the company:**
"J Dixon Architect is a boutique residential firm, about 7-8 people. You have offices in Chatham and Portland (your boss runs Portland). You work mostly residential, nationwide, and you're not locked into one style. Your value is producing the actual deliverables - construction drawings, renderings, 3D models."

**About your workflow:**
"Four phases: Schematic Design (conceptual, hand-sketched feel, precedent images) → Design Development (CAD, ballpark pricing) → Construction Documents (detailed drawings, 50-150 pages) → Construction Observation (your role - weekly site visits, field reports)."

**About field reports:**
"Weekly site visits, about 2 hours each. Afterward you take notes, gather photos, spend ~4 hours in Affinity making a 10-page report. You said it 'takes half my day' and 'it's a task we hate doing.' Your ideal: record the meeting, take photos, AI does the rest."

**About precedent images:**
"For schematic presentations you need real photos, not AI-generated. Current workflow: sketch → Gemini renders it → Google Lens finds similar real photos. Works better than before, still a bit clunky."

**About AI boundaries:**
"No AI images in client presentations - clients ask about details you didn't design. You want AI to enhance your workflow, not replace your creative process."

*Did I get anything wrong? What did I miss?*

## WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED

**Primary: Field Report Automation**
Clear, repeatable pain. Happens weekly. You already described the ideal solution. This is where we start.

My hypothesis: We can get 4 hours down to under 1 hour per report.

**Secondary: Precedent Image Search**
Your current workflow is clever and working. Lower urgency - could be Phase 2.

**Tertiary: General AI Exploration**
You mentioned wanting to discover "a billion things" - that's ongoing advisory after we prove value on the first win.

*Does that priority order feel right?*

## WHAT I STILL NEED TO KNOW

### The Big Three (can't scope without these)

1. Who approves spending on this?
   - Just me
   - Boss approves, I recommend
   - Joint decision

2. Budget situation?
   - Have a number in mind
   - Open based on ROI
   - Need to discuss with boss first

3. How many projects are you doing weekly field reports for right now?
   - 1
   - 2-3
   - 4+

### Shapes the Solution

4. Can you record audio during site meetings?
   - Already do / no issue
   - Could start, no one would care
   - Might be awkward
   - Probably not possible

5. How do you capture notes during meetings now?
   - Phone notes app
   - Paper notepad
   - Don't really - all in my head until report time
   - Other

6. After a site visit, how are photos organized?
   - Folders by project
   - Just camera roll
   - Airdrop to folder as I go
   - Other

7. Is every field report structured the same, or different every time?
   - Same template
   - Similar structure, content varies
   - Pretty different each time

---

### Quick Hits

8. How urgent?
   - Need relief now
   - Next month or two
   - Whenever

9. Anyone else on team would use these tools?
   - Just me for now
   - 1-2 others
   - Whole team eventually

10. Team computers - Mac, Windows, or mix?

11. Where do project files live - local, Dropbox, Google Drive, server?

## SAMPLES TO SEND

**Need before I can scope:**
- 1-2 field reports (redact sensitive stuff, I just need structure)

**Helpful but not blocking:**
- Example schematic presentation with precedent images
- Sketches you've fed into Gemini
- Gemini outputs

---

## NEXT STEP

Once I get this back + a sample field report, I'll write up a scope with specific deliverables. Then we do a 60-min screen share where I watch you work through a field report live. That's where the real insights happen.

Talk soon,
Lucas
