# AI Consulting Discovery Framework

## Purpose
Extract complete requirements, establish shared understanding, and define clear scope before any technical work begins.

---

## Phase 1: Current State Analysis

### Workflow Mapping Questions
| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| What triggers this workflow? | Entry point |
| Who does it? | Stakeholder identification |
| What tools do you use? | Integration requirements |
| How long does it take? | Baseline for ROI |
| How often do you do it? | Frequency = impact multiplier |
| What is the output? | Deliverable definition |
| Who receives the output? | Quality standards |
| What goes wrong? | Pain points |
| What do you wish was different? | Desired state |

### Pain Point Severity Matrix
| Pain Point | Frequency | Time Cost | Frustration (1-10) | Revenue Impact |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Field reports | Weekly+ | 4 hrs each | 8+ | Indirect |
| Precedent search | Per project | 1-2 hrs | 5 | Indirect |

## Phase 2: Prioritization (MoSCoW)

### MUST HAVE (Project fails without)
- To be validated in discovery

### SHOULD HAVE (Significant value)
- To be validated in discovery

### COULD HAVE (If time/budget)
- To be validated in discovery

### WONT HAVE (Explicitly excluded)
- AI-generated images in client deliverables
- Replacing creative design process
- Touching construction documents directly

---

## Phase 3: Staging

**Stage 0: Discovery** - Current
- Objective: Complete understanding of needs
- Deliverable: Scope document, signed off
- Exit Criteria: Both parties articulate scope identically

**Stage 1: Proof of Concept**
- Objective: Validate approach works
- Deliverable: Working prototype
- Exit Criteria: Stakeholder sees it work on real data

**Stage 2: Implementation**
- Objective: Production-ready solution
- Deliverable: Deployed, documented solution
- Exit Criteria: Used successfully in real workflow

**Stage 3: Handoff**
- Objective: Independence
- Deliverable: Training, docs, support period
- Exit Criteria: Team operates without consultant

---

## Phase 4: Validation

### Scope Confirmation Questions
- "When I deliver X, will you consider this project successful?"
- "Is there anything we discussed that I'm NOT including?"
- "What would make you feel this was a waste of money?"
- "What would make you feel this was the best investment?"

### Red Flags to Surface
- Unstated expectations
- Assumed knowledge
- Hidden stakeholders
- Unclear decision-making authority
- Scope creep triggers

---

## Key Questions to Never Skip

### The Clarifying Five
1. Can you show me? (Do not assume - see it)
2. How often does this happen? (Frequency = importance)
3. What happens if this does not get solved? (Stakes)
4. Who else cares about this? (Stakeholders)
5. What have you already tried? (Context)

### The Closing Three
1. What question should I have asked but did not?
2. Is there anyone else I should talk to?
3. What would make you say no to moving forward?

## Discovery Information Mapping

### What the Proposal Needs → What Discovery Must Get

**TO WRITE THE PROBLEM SECTION (50%+ of proposal):**

| What I Need to Write | Why It Matters | What Discovery Must Capture |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| "This is costing you $X/month" | Makes pain concrete | Frequency × Time × Hourly value |
| "Your bottleneck is X" | Focuses the problem | Where specifically workflow breaks |
| "Here are the 3 reasons why" | Shows I understand root cause | WHY the problem exists |
| "By not solving this, you will feel X" | Creates urgency | What happens if nothing changes |

**TO WRITE THE SOLUTION SECTION:**

| What I Need to Write | Why It Matters | What Discovery Must Capture |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| "We will do X which solves Y" | Links solution to pain | What they actually want it to DO |
| "Using [tool] or equivalent" | Concrete but flexible | Technical environment, constraints |

**TO WRITE THE INVESTMENT SECTION:**

| What I Need to Write | Why It Matters | What Discovery Must Capture |
|---------------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| "$X investment returns $Y" | Justifies price with math | Quantified problem cost |
| "To proceed, [name] approves" | Know who I'm selling to | Who decides, who pays |
