## Critical Unknowns (Reduced List)

### Still Must Answer Before Proposal
1. **Report structure/samples** - Need to see actual output on Tuesday
2. **Other PM workflows** - Do all 4 PMs work the same way?
3. **Budget specifics** - Hourly rate expectations? Project ceiling?

### Scope-Definers (Updated)
4. **Solo vs team rollout** - Start with Jesse or all 4 PMs?
5. **Affinity replacement** - Build custom or use existing tool?
6. **Photo correlation complexity** - How precise does matching need to be?

### Technical Validators (Mostly Cleared)
7. ~~Recording allowed?~~ - ANSWERED: Yes
8. ~~Cloud services OK?~~ - LIKELY: Using Gemini already
9. **OS environment** - Still unknown, verify Tuesday

## Updated Hypothesis

### Field Reports (Revised)

**Original hypothesis:**
"Jesse creates 2-4 field reports per week, each taking 3-4 hours. An audio-to-document pipeline could reduce this to 30-60 minutes, saving 6-12 hours/week."

**Updated hypothesis:**
"Jesse already has a working AI pipeline (20-30 min vs 2 hours). The remaining opportunity is the 'last mile' - template-based formatting, photo correlation, and layout. Scaling to 4 PMs × 3 reports/week = 12 reports/week firm-wide."

**New validation questions for Tuesday:**
- What does the Affinity formatting step look like?
- How are photos currently correlated to notes?
- What makes the current output not good enough?
- Would other PMs adopt the same workflow?

### Precedent Images (Deprioritized)

**Status:** Not discussed in follow-up. Field reports are clear priority. Revisit after first project succeeds.

## What We Now Know (Summary)

### Cleared Concerns
- Decision maker identified (Jim)
- Budget approach confirmed (hourly → project)
- Recording is possible (already doing it)
- Frequency is high (12/week firm-wide)
- AI competency exists (Jesse already using Gemini)

### New Insights
- Jesse is ahead of where we thought - not starting from zero
- The value is in the "last mile" not the full pipeline
- Quality/tone matters more than raw speed
- Team scale (4 PMs) is the bigger opportunity
- Affinity is the bottleneck, not AI comprehension

### Remaining Gaps (For Tuesday)
1. See the actual workflow live
2. See sample output (current reports)
3. Understand photo organization/naming
4. Gauge other PMs' interest/capability
5. Discuss specific budget parameters

## Next Steps to Close Gaps

1. [x] ~~Send questionnaire to Jesse~~ (covered verbally)
2. [ ] See samples live on Tuesday screen share
3. [x] ~~Schedule screen share~~ - Tuesday the 9th
4. [x] ~~Identify decision maker~~ - Jim, collaborative
5. [x] ~~Validate hypotheses~~ - Updated above

---

## Opportunity Reframe

**From:** "Build AI pipeline for field reports"
**To:** "Solve the last-mile formatting problem and scale to team"

This is a more focused, faster-to-deliver engagement than originally scoped.
