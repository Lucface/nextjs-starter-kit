# Initial Discovery Call - Jesse Gugliotta

**Date:** November 2024
**Attendees:** Jesse Gugliotta, Lucas Cooper-Bey
**Duration:** ~45 minutes
**Type:** Informal discovery / relationship building

---

## Context
Initial conversation about AI consulting opportunities. Jesse reached out interested in how AI could help streamline workflows at James Dixon Architect PC.

---

## Key Topics Discussed

### 1. Jesse's Interest in AI Consulting
- Actively experimenting with Gemini for image generation
- Open to exploring workflow improvements
- Wants enhancement, not replacement of creative process

### 2. Precedent Image Workflow
- **Current process:** Sketch → Gemini generates realistic image → Google Lens finds real precedent
- **Why not AI images:** Trust with clients, uncontrolled details lead to questions
- **Pain:** Manual search through websites/books was slow before this workaround

### 3. Field Reports (Biggest Pain Point)
- **Current process:** 2hr site meeting → notes → photos → 4hr Affinity layout
- **Explicit request:** "Record my conversations, type up notes, include pictures, give me a field report"
- **Impact:** "Takes half my day"

### 4. Company Overview
- 7-8 employees, boutique residential firm
- Chatham NY + Portland OR offices
- Work phases: Schematic → Design Development → Construction Docs → Construction Observation
- Tools: SketchUp, AutoCAD, Affinity, Gemini, Google Lens

### 5. Cautionary Tale
- Mentioned a $30M Georgian mansion project where another "architect" used AI-generated drawings
- Drawings looked professional but were unbuildable - doors to nowhere, misplaced columns
- Builder couldn't work from it, client needed real architect
- Reinforced why they don't want AI in client deliverables

## Workflow Details Captured

### Schematic Design Phase
- Present design concepts based on client wishlist
- Hand-sketched aesthetic over CAD/SketchUp base
- Use precedent images to evoke emotional response
- Keep things ambiguous - avoid premature client questions about specifics
- 1-2 precedent images per page, 4-5 pages per presentation

### Design Development Phase
- CAD drafting in AutoCAD
- Detailed planning
- Get to ballpark pricing for builder

### Construction Documents Phase
- 50-150 page detailed drawing sets
- Every condition detailed
- Accurate pricing for contract

### Construction Observation Phase (Jesse's role)
- Weekly site visits
- 2-hour meetings with builders
- Take notes, photos
- Create 10-page field report in Affinity
- Takes "half my day" (~4 hours)
