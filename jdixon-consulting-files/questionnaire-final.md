# Pre-Discovery Questionnaire for Jesse

Hey Jesse,

Before we schedule a screen share, I want to make sure I heard you right and fill in a few gaps. Should take 5-10 minutes - mostly checkboxes.

---

## PART 1: DID I GET THIS RIGHT?

Here's what I took away from our conversation. Correct anything I got wrong.

**About the company:**
"J Dixon Architect is a boutique residential firm, about 7-8 people. You have offices in Chatham and Portland (your boss runs Portland). You work mostly residential, nationwide, and you're not locked into one style. Your value is producing the actual deliverables - construction drawings, renderings, 3D models."

[ ] Correct
[ ] Mostly right, but: ____

**About your workflow:**
"Four phases: Schematic Design (conceptual, hand-sketched feel, precedent images) → Design Development (CAD, ballpark pricing) → Construction Documents (detailed drawings, 50-150 pages) → Construction Observation (your role - weekly site visits, field reports)."

[ ] Correct
[ ] Mostly right, but: ____

**About field reports:**
"Weekly site visits, about 2 hours each. Afterward you take notes, gather photos, spend ~4 hours in Affinity making a 10-page report. You said it 'takes half my day' and 'it's a task we hate doing.' Your ideal: record the meeting, take photos, AI does the rest."

[ ] Correct
[ ] Mostly right, but: ____

**About precedent images:**
"For schematic presentations you need real photos, not AI-generated. Current workflow: sketch → Gemini renders it → Google Lens finds similar real photos. Works better than before, still a bit clunky."

[ ] Correct
[ ] Mostly right, but: ____

**About AI boundaries:**
"No AI images in client presentations - clients ask about details you didn't design. You want AI to enhance your workflow, not replace your creative process."

[ ] Correct
[ ] Mostly right, but: ____

## PART 2: WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY WANT?

I heard two potential projects plus general exploration. Which of these are real?

**Field Report Automation** (record → AI → finished report)
[ ] Start here - this is the priority
[ ] Interested but not urgent
[ ] Not that interested actually

**Precedent Image Workflow** (streamline the Gemini → Google Lens thing)
[ ] Include in first project
[ ] Phase 2, after field reports work
[ ] Current workflow is fine for now

**Ongoing AI Advisory** (what else could help across the firm)
[ ] Yes - I want an ongoing relationship, not just one project
[ ] Maybe later, after we prove value
[ ] Just focus on the specific projects

---

## PART 3: THE MATH

I need real numbers to calculate ROI.

1. How many projects have active field reports right now?
   [ ] 1
   [ ] 2-3
   [ ] 4-5
   [ ] 6+

2. Check my math:

   "2 reports/week × 4 hours each = 8 hours/week. That's 400+ hours/year. At $100-150/hour for your time, that's $40K-60K/year on field reports."

   [ ] About right
   [ ] Too high - more like: ____
   [ ] Too low - actually worse

---

## PART 4: WHERE IT BREAKS DOWN

3. Which part of the field report process takes the most time?
   [ ] Writing up notes from memory
   [ ] Finding the right photos
   [ ] Affinity layout (formatting, placement)
   [ ] Writing action items and summaries
   [ ] All of it equally

4. What specifically makes Affinity slow?
   [ ] Placing photos is tedious
   [ ] Writing content takes the most thought
   [ ] Formatting and layout

5. Ever tried to fix this?
   [ ] Never tried anything
   [ ] Tried something, didn't stick: ____
   [ ] Have a system, still slow

## PART 5: WHAT'S AT STAKE

6. If nothing changes in 12 months, what happens?
   [ ] Keep losing half-days (annoying but fine)
   [ ] Burn out or drop balls elsewhere
   [ ] Hit capacity ceiling, can't take more projects
   [ ] Can't focus on higher-value work

---

## PART 6: CAN THIS WORK?

7. Can you record audio during site meetings?
   [ ] Already do / easy
   [ ] Could start, no one would care
   [ ] Would need to ask first
   [ ] Probably too awkward

8. How do you take notes during meetings now?
   [ ] I don't - all in my head
   [ ] Quick phone notes
   [ ] Paper
   [ ] Voice memos

9. How are photos organized after a visit?
   [ ] Project folders as I go
   [ ] Camera roll until I need them
   [ ] Named and organized
   [ ] Honestly a mess

10. Is report structure consistent?
    [ ] Same template every time
    [ ] Same sections, content varies
    [ ] Different each time

---

## SAMPLES

**Need before I can scope:**

**Helpful but not blocking:**
[ ] Raw photos from a recent site visit
[ ] Schematic presentation with precedent images
[ ] Sketch you've fed into Gemini

---

## LAST THINGS

25. What should I have asked but didn't?
    ____

26. Anything else?
    ____

---

## NEXT

Once I get this + a sample report:
1. I send you a scope doc (what we build, how it works, cost, ROI)
2. We do a 60-min screen share where I watch you work
3. If it looks good, we start

Talk soon,
Lucas
