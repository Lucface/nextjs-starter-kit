# AI Consulting Discovery Framework

## Purpose
Extract complete requirements, establish shared understanding, and define clear scope before any technical work begins.

---

## Phase 1: Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Business Context
- What does your company do? (elevator pitch)
- How many people? Roles?
- Who are your clients?
- What's your competitive advantage?
- What keeps you busy vs. what makes you money?

### 1.2 Workflow Mapping
For each major workflow:
| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| What triggers this workflow? | Entry point |
| Who does it? | Stakeholder identification |
| What tools do you use? | Integration requirements |
| How long does it take? | Baseline for ROI |
| How often do you do it? | Frequency = impact multiplier |
| What's the output? | Deliverable definition |
| Who receives the output? | Quality standards |
| What goes wrong? | Pain points |
| What do you wish was different? | Desired state |

### 1.3 Pain Point Severity Matrix
Rate each pain point:
| Pain Point | Frequency | Time Cost | Frustration (1-10) | Revenue Impact |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Example    | Daily     | 2 hrs     | 8                 | Indirect       |

### 1.4 Current Tools Inventory
| Tool | Purpose | Satisfaction (1-10) | Would Replace? | Integrates With |
|------|---------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|

---

## Phase 2: Desired State Definition

### 2.1 The Magic Wand Question
"If you could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing about how you work, what would it be?"

### 2.2 Success Criteria
For each identified need:
- What does "solved" look like?
- How would you know it's working?
- What metrics matter?
- What's the minimum viable improvement?

### 2.3 Constraints & Boundaries
- What must NOT change?
- What are you not willing to give up?
- What's off the table? (budget, time, tools, process)
- Who needs to approve changes?
- What compliance/legal/industry requirements exist?

---

## Phase 3: Prioritization Framework

### 3.1 Impact vs. Effort Matrix

```
HIGH IMPACT
    │
    │  Quick Wins     │  Major Projects
    │  (DO FIRST)     │  (PLAN CAREFULLY)
    │─────────────────┼─────────────────
    │  Fill-ins       │  Time Sinks
    │  (DO IF TIME)   │  (AVOID/DEFER)
    │
    └─────────────────┴─────────────────→ HIGH EFFORT
```

### 3.2 MoSCoW Prioritization
For each identified opportunity:

**MUST HAVE** (Critical - project fails without these)
- Non-negotiable requirements
- Blocking issues
- Compliance requirements

**SHOULD HAVE** (Important - significant value)
- High-impact improvements
- Strong ROI items
- Competitive advantages

**COULD HAVE** (Nice to have - if time/budget allows)
- Quality of life improvements
- Future-proofing
- Polish items

**WON'T HAVE** (Not this time - explicitly excluded)
- Out of scope
- Future phases
- Acknowledged but deferred

### 3.3 Dependency Mapping
- What needs to happen before X can happen?
- What blocks what?
- What unlocks the most downstream value?

---

## Phase 4: Scope Definition

### 4.1 Project Boundary Statement
"This project WILL deliver: ___"
"This project will NOT deliver: ___"
"This project ASSUMES: ___"

### 4.2 Deliverables Checklist
For each deliverable:
| Deliverable | Format | Owner | Acceptance Criteria | Dependencies |
|-------------|--------|-------|---------------------|--------------|

### 4.3 Staging Framework

**Stage 0: Discovery & Alignment** (YOU ARE HERE)
- Objective: Complete understanding of needs
- Deliverable: Scope document, signed off by stakeholders
- Exit Criteria: Both parties can articulate scope identically

**Stage 1: Proof of Concept**
- Objective: Validate approach works
- Deliverable: Working prototype of core functionality
- Exit Criteria: Stakeholder sees it work on real data

**Stage 2: Implementation**
- Objective: Build production-ready solution
- Deliverable: Deployed, documented solution
- Exit Criteria: Used successfully in real workflow

**Stage 3: Handoff & Training**
- Objective: Independence
- Deliverable: Training, documentation, support period
- Exit Criteria: Team operates without consultant

**Stage 4: Review & Next Phase**
- Objective: Measure results, identify next opportunities
- Deliverable: ROI report, next phase proposal
- Exit Criteria: Decision on continuation

---

## Phase 5: Validation & Sign-off

### 5.1 Scope Confirmation Questions
- "When I deliver X, will you consider this project successful?"
- "Is there anything we discussed that I'm NOT including here?"
- "What would make you feel this was a waste of money?"
- "What would make you feel this was the best investment you made?"

### 5.2 Red Flags to Surface
- Unstated expectations
- Assumed knowledge
- Hidden stakeholders
- Unclear decision-making authority
- Scope creep triggers

### 5.3 Sign-off Template
```
PROJECT SCOPE AGREEMENT

Project: _______________
Client: _______________
Consultant: _______________
Date: _______________

CONFIRMED DELIVERABLES:
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED:

## Discovery Session Agenda Template

3. **Pain point deep-dive** (20 min) - For each pain, ask "tell me more"
4. **Dream state** (15 min) - Magic wand question
5. **Wrap-up** (5 min) - Confirm next steps

### Post-Session
- Send summary within 24 hours
- Include: "Here's what I heard. What did I miss?"
- Schedule follow-up for clarification

### Session 2: Validation (30-45 min)
1. **Playback** (15 min) - "Here's what I think you need"
2. **Correction** (15 min) - "What did I get wrong?"
3. **Prioritization** (10 min) - MoSCoW exercise together
4. **Next steps** (5 min) - Proposal timeline

## Key Questions to Never Skip

### The Clarifying Five
1. "Can you show me?" (Don't assume - see it)
2. "How often does this happen?" (Frequency = importance)
3. "What happens if this doesn't get solved?" (Stakes)
4. "Who else cares about this?" (Stakeholders)
5. "What have you already tried?" (Context)

### The Closing Three
1. "What question should I have asked but didn't?"
2. "Is there anyone else I should talk to?"
3. "What would make you say no to moving forward?"
