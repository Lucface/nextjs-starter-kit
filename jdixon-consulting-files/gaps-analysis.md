# Gaps Analysis: Known vs Unknown

## Status Key
- KNOWN - Confirmed from conversation

## Critical Unknowns (Must Answer Before Proposal)

### Deal-Breakers
1. **Who decides?** - Cannot propose without knowing who approves
2. **Budget exists?** - Affects scope and approach
3. **Frequency of pain** - 1 report/month vs 5/week = different ROI

### Scope-Definers
4. **Field report structure** - Need sample to design solution
5. **Success metrics** - What does done look like?
6. **Other users** - Solo tool vs team tool = different complexity

### Technical Validators
7. **Recording allowed?** - Core assumption for field report solution
8. **Cloud services OK?** - Affects tool selection
9. **OS environment** - Mac vs Windows = different tooling

---

## Hypothesis to Validate

### Field Reports
"Jesse creates 2-4 field reports per week, each taking 3-4 hours. An audio-to-document pipeline could reduce this to 30-60 minutes, saving 6-12 hours/week."

**Validation questions:**
- Actual frequency?
- Actual time per report?
- Would audio recording work in site meetings?
- Acceptable output quality?

### Precedent Images
"The current Gemini → Google Lens workflow works but adds 30-60 min per presentation. A refined pipeline could cut this to 10-15 min."

**Validation questions:**
- Actual time spent currently?
- How many presentations affected?
- What's the real friction point?
- Is this urgent or just annoying?

## Next Steps to Close Gaps

1. [ ] Send questionnaire to Jesse
2. [ ] Request samples (field report, presentation, sketches)
3. [ ] Schedule screen share to watch workflows live
4. [ ] Identify decision maker and budget holder
5. [ ] Validate hypotheses with real numbers
