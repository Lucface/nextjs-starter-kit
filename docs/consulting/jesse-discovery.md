# Jesse Discovery: Architecture Firm AI Consulting

## What We Know vs. What We Need to Know

### ✅ KNOWN (from conversation)

**Business Context**
- Small boutique architecture firm, 7-8 employees
- Offices in Yorktown + Portland, Oregon
- Mostly residential, work nationwide
- Not style-locked - versatile team
- Jesse's role: Likely project management, construction observation

**Workflow Phases Mentioned**
1. Schematic Design (conceptual presentations)
2. Design Development (CAD drafting, budget estimates)
3. Construction Documents (100-150 page drawing sets)
4. Construction Observation (site visits, field reports)

**Tools Mentioned**
| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| SketchUp | 3D modeling | |
| AutoCAD | Drafting, hardline drawings | Primary tool |
| Affinity | Field reports, presentations | "Like Illustrator" |
| Gemini | Image generation | Currently experimenting |
| Google Lens | Reverse image search | Finding precedent images |

**Explicit Pain Points**
1. Finding precedent images is slow/manual
2. Field reports take "half my day"

**Explicit Requests**
1. "Record conversations → AI notes → pictures → field report"
2. Better precedent image discovery workflow

**Constraints Stated**
- Don't want AI-generated images in client presentations
- Don't want AI to replace creative/collaborative process
- Deliverables (construction docs, renderings) are their value prop

### ❓ UNKNOWN (must discover)

**Business Context Gaps**
- [ ] Who is the decision-maker for this engagement? Jesse or his boss?
- [ ] What's the budget range? Any budget at all established?
- [ ] What's the timeline pressure? Urgent or exploratory?
- [ ] Who else on the team would use these tools?
- [ ] What's the boss's appetite for AI adoption?

**Workflow Gaps - Field Reports**
- [ ] How many field reports per week/month?
- [ ] Can I see an example field report?
- [ ] What's the exact structure/template?
- [ ] What information is required vs. nice-to-have?
- [ ] Who receives the field reports? What do they do with them?
- [ ] Are there compliance/legal requirements for format?
- [ ] What recording setup exists? Phone? Dedicated recorder?
- [ ] How many photos per report? How are they currently organized?
- [ ] What's the current naming/filing system?

**Workflow Gaps - Precedent Images**
- [ ] How many precedent images per presentation?
- [ ] How many schematic design presentations per month?
- [ ] What makes a "good" precedent image?
- [ ] What sources are acceptable? (other architects' sites, stock, etc.)
- [ ] Any licensing/attribution requirements?
- [ ] Can I see an example schematic design presentation?

**Technical Gaps**
- [ ] What computers/OS does the team use?
- [ ] Comfort level with new software?
- [ ] Any IT restrictions? Cloud services OK?
- [ ] Where do files live? (Local, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

**Success Criteria Gaps**
- [ ] What does "this worked" look like for field reports?
- [ ] What does "this worked" look like for precedent search?
- [ ] If field reports went from 4hrs to Xhr, what's the target?
- [ ] How will we measure success?

## Prioritization Hypothesis (to validate)

Based on conversation, my read:

### MUST HAVE (Project 1)
- **Field Report Automation**
  - Why: Explicit pain ("takes half my day"), explicit request, clear ROI
  - Confidence: HIGH - he described exactly what he wants

### SHOULD HAVE (Project 1 or 2)
- **Precedent Image Workflow**
  - Why: Clear use case, actively experimenting with solutions
  - Confidence: MEDIUM - workflow is working, just slow

### COULD HAVE (Future)
- **Broader AI education for team**
  - Why: "Bringing you in will make us realize there's a billion things"
  - Confidence: LOW - exploratory, not urgent

### WON'T HAVE (Explicitly out)
- AI-generated images for client deliverables
- Replacing creative/collaborative design process
- Anything touching construction documents directly

## Pre-Discovery Questionnaire to Send Jesse

### Section 1: Quick Snapshot
1. Who makes the decision to move forward with consulting? Just you, or does your boss need to approve?
2. Is there a budget range you're working within, or are we figuring that out based on value?
3. What's driving the timing? Is this "when we get to it" or "I need relief now"?

### Section 2: Field Reports (Your Biggest Pain)
4. How many field reports do you create per week/month on average?
5. Can you send me a sample field report (redacted if needed)?
6. Walk me through the current process step-by-step:
   - How do you take notes during meetings?
   - How do you capture/organize photos?
   - How long does the Affinity layout take?
7. Who receives the field report? What do they do with it?
8. Are there any legal/compliance requirements for field report format or content?
9. If you could cut the time in half, what's that worth to you in dollars or hours/week?

### Section 3: Precedent Images
10. How many schematic design presentations do you do per month?
11. How many precedent images per presentation?
12. Can you send me an example presentation (redacted if needed)?
13. What makes a precedent image "good" vs. "not quite right"?
14. The current Gemini → Google Lens workflow - what's frustrating about it?

### Section 4: Team & Tech
15. Who else on the team would use these tools?
16. What computers does the team use? (Mac/Windows)
17. Where do your files live? (Local drives, Dropbox, Google Drive, server?)
18. Any software restrictions from IT or company policy?
19. How would you rate the team's comfort level with new software? (1-10)

### Section 5: Success
20. If we nail the field report solution, what does success look like?
21. What would make you feel like this consulting engagement was worth it?
22. What would make you feel like it was a waste?

## Samples to Request

- [ ] 1-2 field reports (redacted is fine)
- [ ] 1 schematic design presentation with precedent images
- [ ] Example sketches used as input for Gemini
- [ ] Example Gemini outputs
- [ ] Example "good" precedent images found via current workflow

---

## Next Steps

1. **Send questionnaire to Jesse** (pre-work before next call)
2. **Request samples** (see above)
3. **Schedule 60-min discovery call** to:
   - Watch him do a field report (screen share)
   - Watch him do precedent image search (screen share)
   - Validate prioritization
   - Identify decision-maker and budget
4. **Deliver scope document** within 48hrs of call
5. **Get sign-off** before any technical work

## Open Questions for You (Consultant)

Before talking to Jesse again:
- What's your rate / how do you want to price this? (Hourly, project, retainer?)
- Are you doing the implementation, or discovery + recommendation?
- What's your capacity? Can you deliver in their timeline?
- Do you have the skills for: audio transcription pipelines, document generation, image workflows?
- What's your minimum engagement size?
